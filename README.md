## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I try to visualize this data and answer some question:
+ Which city have most complaint?
+ How long does it take to process a complaint?
+ What is the status of the complaints?

Answer those questions help government process complaint better.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
